# Data analysis project on Twitch (project off Codecademy)

Twitch is the world’s leading video platform and community.
In this project, CodeCademy have partnered with Twitch’s Science Team and provided some data (scrubbed and for practice use only) with two related tables that describe user engagement with Twitch video and chat. 

The original files are available here on [GitHub] (https://github.com/Codecademy/datasets/tree/master/twitch)

The project is broken down into two parts:

## Part 1
Analyze Gaming Data with SQL

## Part 2

Visualize Gaming Data with Matplotlib
